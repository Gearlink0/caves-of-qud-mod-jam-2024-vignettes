A skittish arconaut rummages through bygone refuse. They are farther below than they should be, and they know it. Behind them, a shadowed shape approaches, claws glinting with anticipation. Something alerts the arconaut and they flee, firing wildly backwards. The lasers diffuse past astral flesh, and the tabby follows.

Months pass, and the arconaut and the tabby find an uneasy friendship. Careful use of phase-shift grenades lets the tabby find easy meals and keeps the arconaut safe as they delve into lower strata.

Years pass, and the arconaut's laser pistol becomes a favorite toy of the tabby. It spends hours chasing the laserlight around the arconaut's home, and is treated to glowfish as Hindsun arrives.
