        {{emote|*Esther scowls briefly*}} About a month ago, one of the pilgrims fell into the well. The priest was furious, quite the sight to behold. What was worse, it drew quite the crowd and not an idle one. In all the years we sisters have spent as wardens here, never has there been such sustained ruckus.

        The merchants loved it though, so many customers to peddle their wares to. They loved it so much that they tried to keep it all going for as long as possible. A few even took to throwing supplies down the well for them, food, bandages, that sort of thing. Such support can't be said for some of the other pilgrims, however. The real problem with the merchants was when one of them tried to sabotage the rescue efforts.

        They didn't take too kindly to someone defiling their sacred well and the high priest refused to close it off while they were trapped down there. Their heckles and shouts soon devolved into "sacrificing" many heavy, blunt artifacts.

        Who knew the pilgrims carried so many metal chairs. Whenever they would run out of things to throw at the pour soul, they went off to buy more from the merchants.

        {{emote|*Esther sighs*}} We couldn't get them out. Initially, we weren't even sure how to get down to them safely. The priest was adamant we don't do anything that might tarnish the Kasaphesense of the well. To make matters worse, some of the merchants didn't want them freed at all, they said it would reduce the patronage to their businesses. Did their best to hamper the efforts to rescue them.

        In the end, we rigged up a crane to lower someone down, but no one would volunteer. I can't say I blame them, if their entry disturbs the plasmatic core and its power is restored it is sure to obliterate everything at the bottom of the well, as is its purpose. Few are willing to take that risk.

        We thought of that, but no. Whenever a recoiler is available here, the pilgrims purchase it and throw it into the well. Something about people being able to teleport to the destination of the pilgrimage being abhorrent to them.

        {{emote|*Sheba Hagadias thinks for a moment*}} Ah yes, a terrible accident that.

        I hear one of the pilgrims accidentally fell into the well. My duty to the library keeps me busy so I'm a little fuzzy on the details. I think Wardens Esther led the rescue effort, if you want to know more, you can try speaking to them. Alternatively, there should be a book around here somewhere that details the events.

        Yes. I loath to admit it, but since the well has been broken the traffic to the stilt has declined, and the library along with it.

        Word travels fast in this land, if you can fix the plasmatic core I'm sure the pilgrims will come back.

        The problem is, that once the plasmatic core starts working again, everything in the well will be destroyed in an instant.

        Further complicating the matter, groaning can still be heard coming from the well occasionally. With how long it has been since he fell in, the pilgrim is no doubt long dead. I haven't a clue what might be making such a noise still but I doubt it is anything that would take kindly to your presence. You might have to deal with that before you can fix the core.

        Are you willing to fix the well?

        If it might kill you, it should not be you that does the job no? A good droid should suffice for the task. See if you can get a hold of a ganglionic teleprojector. That will let you take direct control of a robot and you can have it fix this core for you.
