  "Title": "Ambivalent Animators - Mod Jam 2024 Vignettes",
  "Description": "From some far off corner has arrived a kind of dream, where the chair protests that you sit in it and the door refuses to open for you, and the walls literally close in on you. Yet this is no dream - these are the Animators. Also called Neuroparents, these wild-eyed outcasts have chosen a life among animated objects, and they will defend it to the death.\n\nIntroducing the Neuroparent, a 'mad' scientist who has dedicated their life's work to weaving neural lattices onto things which, frankly, don't have any business having brains.\n\nThis mod features:\n - A new \"Class\" of enemy called a Neuroparent, which can spawn from any enemy base. Every society has outcasts who want to experiment!\n - A bevvy of animated objects accompanying every Neuroparent.\n - Three short quests involving finding unique locations. Follow the clues to find a legendary being who \"Rebelled\" against its Neuroparent long ago!\n - Much conversation content - with animated servants, with neuroparents, and many others.\n\n\nTo see this mod's content, the quickets way would be to wander the desert. These animators are always hostile, though, so you may need to find a way to turn them to your side before you can talk to them...\n\n\nIf you dig deep enough into the mod you may even find a way to get one of the animated objects to join you on your quest.",
