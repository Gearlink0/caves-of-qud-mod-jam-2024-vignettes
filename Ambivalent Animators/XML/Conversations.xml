  <!--Conversation: Yurl tells you the location of Safra-->

  <!--Notes:
		- The quest, An Animated Refuge leads to a spawn group of two animators (one legendary) and a large group of animated objects. These are friendly. They both carry Nano-Neuro Animators and one of them has a sheaf of paper with scrawled notes
			- In the camp will be a purple chest with an artifact in it. This chest is living.
		- The quest, "A Life Untethered" leads to a Baroque ruin strata zero with a grouping inside it that has smashed chairs and a barrel of pickled cucumbers.


		- After retrieving either of these items, you can then talk to Yurl, who will tell you where to find Safra, the Legendary Sentient Basket

		Safra will reward you for bringing Xem nano-neuro animators and Spray-A-Brains taken from dead Neuroparents (these use a different blueprint)
		Safra is an animated sentient basket that is cyan in color. Xey will spawn in one of the outskirts of Yd after retrieving the info from Yurl. If you know about Safra, you can ask Une about Xem, but Une knows very little.

			Safra Secret		> Given by Yurl alongside quest
				Generator for Safra Secret

			Pickle Ruin Secret	> Given by Neuroparent when asked "Do your beauties disobey you"
				Generator for Pickle Ruin

			Camp Secret			> Given by Neuroparent when finishing quest "An Animated Refuge"
				Try .rpm files that are already inbuilt?
