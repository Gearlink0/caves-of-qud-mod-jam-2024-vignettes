        Oh a visitor! Hello, =player.formalAddressTerm= how did you find your way here?
        
        Excuse, me if you will. It has been sometime since any new friendly faces where here.

        Years. Decades Maybe.
        
        I don't rightly remember how long it's been since I had a friendly visitor. Much less how long ago we arrived here.
        
        ...You are friendly right?

        It's quite embarrassing really. I wont't let my embarrassment stifle your curiousity, though.
        
        ...My group and I got lost after finding a set of ruins. My poor navigation skills are to blame, I'm afraid.

        My condolences friend, or perhaps my congratulations? Since you are here, I assume Grit Gate still stands?
        
        I have weathered my fair share of attacks from the templar myself, with my fellows here we fair well for now.
        
        ...Do you know the way there?

        I know not of them, =name=, only of Barathrum, and the tinkers around me.
        
        Barathrum, kin I have never met, I have heard a great deal about him, it is hard not too he is ancient after all.
        
        The tinkers, my friends, their secrets are not mine to share.
