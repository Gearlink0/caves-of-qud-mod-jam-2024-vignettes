		<text>
			Many sunrises have seen me called 'Foolish.' I do not mind being a fool.~
			The salt is not good for my shell, and so I have been called 'Oblivious.' I do not mind knowing less than others.~
			My eye is not as good as it once was, and some have called me 'Blind.' It's true; I follow the rhythm of my heart and the sound of the wind, and must trust them in the absence of sight.~
			I must look quite powerful to you, but some have called me 'Weak.' Out of cowardice, I have allowed weakness to hold back my arm and my tongue. I think it suits me.
		</text>
		<choice GotoID="Start">That is quite the name.</choice>
	</node>

	<node ID="What">
		<text>
			Because it pleases me.~
			Because the sun enriches me.~
			Because my heart gives me no choice.~
			Because motion compels me, always.

	<node ID="Where">

			To the Six Day Stilt and beyond. I may rest, even for years at a time, but I will never stop.

			Not so. You need not trouble yourself with me, for I aim to go where you can not.
